# fantasy-football-assistant
A reproducible, data-driven draft assistant that helps fantasy football managers make smarter picks via projections, value-over-replacement (VORP), and roster construction optimization.
This repository is for U-M SIADS 496 â€” Milestone II.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
Ingest multi-source NFL data (historical stats, depth charts, ADP).
Model player projections and uncertainty.
Rank players using VORP and positional scarcity.
Optimize draft decisions under league settings (scoring, roster slots).
Explain recommendations (feature importances, scenario tips).


## ðŸ§© Milestone 2 Scope (Whatâ€™s Done)
Project problem statement & success metrics
Data audit + EDA notebooks
Clean data schema + processing pipeline
Baseline projection models (e.g., regressor + heuristics)
Initial ranking logic (VORP) & sanity checks
Draft-time UI (alpha) with position filters and replacement-level logic
Unit tests for core utilities
